# AlphaZero Artificial Intellignence
This project is an implementation of an artificial intelligence inspired by the paper "AlphaGo Zero cheat sheet" develloped by Google.

The artificial intelligence (ai) is the class "AI" in the module "artificial_intelligence/ai.py". For a given position of a game state, the ai gives the best next move. To found this next move, it can use 2 main method :
 - Monte Carlo Tree Search ("ai.montecarlo_treesearch"), it doesn't use neural network but use monte carlo method to build the research tree (you can view the description on wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)
 - Neural Network Tree Search ("ai.neuralnetwork_treesearch"), 

I will use :
- the reducing dimensions method.
- the unsupervised learning method.
<a/>

To try to obtain subsets of similar elements that correspond to the human recognition of numbers.
