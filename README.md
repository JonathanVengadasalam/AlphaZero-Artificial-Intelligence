# AlphaZero Artificial Intellignence
This project is an implementation of an artificial intelligence inspired by the paper "AlphaGo Zero cheat sheet" develloped by Google (https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0)

The artificial intelligence (ai) is the class "AI" in https://github.com/JonathanVengadasalam/AlphaZero-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/artificial_intelligence/ai.py. For a given position of a game state, the ai gives the best next move. To found this next move, it can use 2 main method :
 - Monte Carlo Tree Search ("ai.montecarlo_treesearch"), it doesn't use neural network but use monte carlo method to build the research tree (you can view the description on wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)
 - Neural Network Tree Search ("ai.neuralnetwork_treesearch"), 

I will use :
- the reducing dimensions method.
- the unsupervised learning method.
<a/>

To try to obtain subsets of similar elements that correspond to the human recognition of numbers.
