# mnist_unsupervized_learning
unsupervized learning on mnist data (handwritten digit)

Hi guys!

This project concerns the study of handwritten numbers in digits of mnist dataset.

I will use :
- the reducing dimensions method.
- the unsupervised learning method.

To try to obtain subsets of similar elements that correspond to the human recognition of numbers.
