# Neural Network Models
The network models are inspired by the works of DeepMind. You can see the architecture in their [paper](https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0) in the section "the deep neural network architecture".

The module need to install TensorFLow library, see the link : (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

I already build my own network model in the function `neural_network_models.build_model`.
